# Greetings. This is my small project with info about me

I used Vite and Tailwind. 
It's overengineering for such a small project 
but I have plans to use this environment and add more features and content in future

To start project as usual just 
1. Clone repo
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run dev`

Deployed version is here
